- you can only pass information down (parent to child)
- created in key value pairs
  - key=value
- on the component receiving the props, it will come in as an object in the parameters
  - most commonly named props
  - we can destructure the object to get the keys we need

## ternary - if/else statement that has a special syntax

- condition ? true : false

## Conditional Rendering - only show something if a certain condition is met
